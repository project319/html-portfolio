<H1>Top 3 Action Movies</H1>
<H2> My favorite Action Packed Movies </H2>
<HR/>
<H3>1. Avengers Infinity War </H3>
<P> Avengers Inifity War is a very story focused super hero action film. This movie has a lot of scenes that make the comics come to life.  </P>
<H3>2. John Wick </H3>
<P>John Wick is one of my favorite action films because it takes Kong-fu and other marital arts and applies them with guns and other weapons to make a unquie film series. I alos enjoy how you can tell how the movie was not epected to become a cult classic and yet due to the increasing world building and action packed scences it has grown a massive fan base.</P>
<H3>3.Avengers End Game </H3>
<P> The sequel to Avengers Infinity War is even more action packed. Where I loved inifinity War for it's story telling and culmination of 20+ prequels. End Game is one of my favorites to to the fan service with various characters and action scenes </P>
